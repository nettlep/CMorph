# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original description

In the early-90's, the popularity of 2D morphing was at its peak. The Complete Morph (a.k.a. CMorph) was one of the most popular of the bunch. CMorph was even a low-cost solution for many television production houses around the world.

I've released the source code. Since CMorph is DOS-based and requires the Watcom compiler, I've also made available the DOS binaries (see the `bin` folder) and an [animation produced by CMorph](https://nettlep.github.io/CMorph/assets/cmorph.mp4).

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
